### About hw0105

The test part is not complete as I don't know how to complete it
* Email's test is bad as some combination of domain will pass (eg. ta@cise.cool, 41247039s@nntu.deu.wt)
* Email's test will skip subject's input if wrong local/domain
* Subject's test will skip score's input if no category

I will try to fix the bug above, but if I can't fix it I hope the correct part of the code get some points.
Thank you TA.
