# Bonus: Makefile for Multiple files

To make sure `make` will run through all rules even error is occured before ends, there are 2 ways to do it.

First, by running `make` with `-i` or `--ignore-errors` flag.

Second, by adding `-` at the beginning of the line's text. To modify the Makefile in hw0106,

```
all:
	-gcc a.c -o a
	-gcc b.c -o b
```
